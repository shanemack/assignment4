				<p>For the final project I will create a website that provides examples of my writing, along with content that informs people of the reason behind my passion for, and style of writing. My website will be a way to show people my capabilities as a writer, while also connecting with them on a more personal level through original, engaging, and enlightening content.

					
				</p>
				<p>
					The reason a professional or business may want to visit my website is if they are seeking a new, fresh writer with the ability to create writing material for diverse purposes. A professional/business can use my website as a way to learn more about my writing skill and style, through my brief insights of myself, and examples of my previous work. My website also provides an avenue of communication for them to contact me to further discuss their interests in having me write for them or for clarification of the structure in which I work with my clients.
				</p>

			<div id="intro">
				<h1>Intro</h1>
				<p>
					As a freelance writer, I am always working on writing new content that can be applied to different industries and featured in different forms of writing. A publishing company may come across my website to explore my writing portfolio and learn more about me as a writer. 
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="aboutMe">
				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>My website is primarily to market myself as a writer, but also to build a relationship with others and allow them to connect with my writing on a deeper level. Young adults may have interest in exploring my website because they want to read some of my writing that speaks on topics they find relevant or interesting. 
 				</p>
 			</div>
				
			<div id="websites">
				<h1>Websites</h1>
				<p> Websites like that of writer John C. Maxwell, Rupi Kaur, and Jill Fritzo. I chose these three websites because they each have something that I want to embody as a professional and elude through my website. John C. Maxwell’s website shows his talents as a professional, while also showing his personality and passion for uplifting and empowering people. As Rupi Kaur does on her website, I would like for my website to provide understanding of the motivation and vision behind my art and projects. Something I would like to do which is similar to publicist Jill Fritzo, is have my writing featured on various platforms. Jill Fritzo’s website explains why her work is so affective, and has been able to make it to the level of success it has. 
				</p>
				
				<p>Three sites that reflect what id like to emulate are: </br>
					<a href="https://www.threadless.com/forum/artdesign" target="_blank">Threadless</a></br>
					<a href="http://laforum.org/" target="_blank">LA Forum</a></br>
					<a href="http://www.artsy.net/" target="_blank">Artsy</a></br>
				</p>
				<p> 
					The reason i chose these sites is because i draw inspiration from each one of them. They all are very informational and aesthetically pleasing to look at.
